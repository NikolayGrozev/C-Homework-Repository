# C-Homework-Repository
This is a repository where i upload my C homework


For some reason in the makefiles it used to work with the linux command rm and windows extension .exe, i just started working in another directory, different from this one where it doesn't work anymore and  i don't know why it worked here in the first place when i uploaded things. If make clean doesn't work on windows, change the rm command with del and if it doesn't work on linux, change the extensions from .exe to .out
